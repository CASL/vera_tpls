README For CASL-VERA tpls  V 1.0

The tpl libraries for VERA are divided by compiler then by package and common
directory with the 'common' directory holding only tpls with shared usage
between multiple packages.  Common files should be vetted to ensure usability
and common compilation setting before added to the common directory.  The tpls
are subdivided by tpl name then version number.  The overall structure should
be represented as shown below.

The Base directory can be set to the needs of VERA but for this example it is
assumed to be /projects on the fissile machines and /localprojects on BORIS
and NATASHA.  For the below illustration the base directory will be
represented by $VERA_TPL_BASE.

Please note, this readme file is a living document and with VERA being in
active development this readme file is subject to change.  The reader will
also find helpful documentation on the CASL-DEV trac site at:

    casl-dev.ornl.gov/trac/casl_vri_kanban

(search for TPLs info).

Users can find specific TPL requirements in each package's respective
Dependencies.cmake or in XML dependency files.  Please review individual tpl
build scripts for further information.

RAB: 2013-01-16: We need some type of documentation here describing how to go
about building and installing the TPLs on a given platform.  Just looking for
"build script" is not sufficient.
